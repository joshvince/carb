        Bread has had a long and varied career all over the world and its strength lies in its variety.
        Functioning variously as a delivery mechanism, a stand-in plate or even as its own course in a restaurant,
        bread has been enjoyed by humanity since the dawn of agriculture and is, some say, The Face of Carbs.

        After an early career in Han-dynasty China, noodles found a new audience in the west
        by adopting a Germanic name (Nudle) and have gone from strength to strength. A workhorse
        of many cuisines across the East and beyond known for its variety and versatility,
        Noodles are the backbone of countless delicious dishes and, contentiously, even another contender itself.

            Confusion abounds about terminology (Americans insist on referring to Spaghetti as Noodles) and The Great Schism

            primarily east Asian cuisine offerings in ranking decisions, rather than in the etymological sense.
            Pasta must not be considered when voting for Noodles. See below.

        Bursting onto the scene relatively late compared to its august peers (likely starting its career in Etruscan-era Italy),
        Pasta is a classic flair player with a southern European swagger.
        Forming the basis of many Italian dishes, Pasta's personality shines through
        in the hundreds of quirky shapes it takes in contrast to its more austere Noodle proginator.

            Pasta is famously the root cause of much contention in The Community. Today, The Carb Question
            is almost excusively posed using the Balham Derivation, which completely differentiates Italian-style Pasta from
            noodles in The Question. Historically of course this was seen by players from both Asia and The Americas
            as symptomatic of European Hegemony, but since the summit at Balham has been simply been recognised as
            being part of a fun game where everyone needs to chill the fuck out.

        while showcasing its skill and versatility in elevating itself. A firm fan favourite with some beloved specialities.

            Potato is traditionally more straightforward and easy to grasp as a choice, even for
            complete newcomers to The Question. A bottom-up movement of potato fans in 2018 - known as The Findon Spuds -
            led to a groundswell of public opinion to begin allowing Sweet Potato when considering Potato as a
            ranking choice.

            Since Sweet Potato's semi-official inclusion into this contender, more and more literature has been

            Yams and even Turnips. However, such lobbying is strictly unofficial and while governmental bodies tolerate it,
