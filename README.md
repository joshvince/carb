# ISOCRA website

This website is a project I carried out for the Independent Society of Carb Rankers.

The site allows users to vote on which carb is best.

It is a Rails app, and is monumentally stupid. I created it in a couple of days for a laugh. If you're someone reading this in a professional capacity, I should probably
point out that this was just a toy project and might contain Cursor-generated monstrosities.
